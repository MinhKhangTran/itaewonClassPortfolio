          On the first day of attending his new high school, Park Sae-Ro-Yi
          (Park Seo-Joon) punches his classmate Jang Geun-Won, who was bullying
          another classmate. The bully is the son of CEO Jang Dae-Hee (Yoo
          Jae-Myung). The bully's father runs restaurant business Jagga where
          Park Sae-Ro-Yi’s own father works. CEO Jang Dae-Hee demands to Park
          Sae-Ro-Yi that he apologizes to his son, but Park Sae-Ro-Yi refuses.
          Because of his refusal, Park Sae-Ro-Yi gets expelled from school and
          his father gets fired from his job. Soon, an accident takes place.
          Park Sae-Ro-Yi’s father dies in a motorcycle accident caused by his
          ex-classmate Jang Geun-Won. Burning with anger, Park Sae-Ro-Yi
          viciously beats Jang Geun-Won. He is soon arrested and receives prison
          time for the violent assault. Park Sae-Ro-Yi decides to destroy the
          Jagga company and take revenge upon CEO Jang Dae-Hee and his son Jang
          Geun-Won. Once Park Sae-Ro-Yi is released from prison, he opens a
          restaurant in Itaewon, Seoul. Jo Yi-Seo (Kim Da-Mi), who is popular on
          social media, joins Park Sae-Ro-Yi’s restaurant and works there as a
          manger. She has feelings for Park Sae-Ro-Yi.
